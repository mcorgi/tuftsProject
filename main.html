        <h3>What is Click to Text?</h3>
        <p>Click to Text is a website that uses AI to convert handwritten documents into text. When you go to <a id = "link" href ="output_page.html">Text Converter,</a> you can either upload your own file or see various documents that have been converted into text using AI. </p>


        <h3 id = "theProcess">The Process</h3>
        <p>To create Click to Text, we had people working on the front and back ends. The front-end coders created this website to present what the back-end coders had been working on. </p>
        <h3 class = "theEnds">The Front-End</h3>
        <p>The front-end coders focused on the presentation of the group's work, so their main focus was on the website. They created the code for the website in HTML & CSS and considered things like functionality and decoration. So, they made sure that all the buttons worked, and they came up with the color scheme, templates, and logo for the Click to Text website.</p>
        <h3 class = "theEnds">The Back-End</h3>
        <p>The back-end coders used Python and Flask to ensure that the model worked. Flask allows the program to take input and release output. Within this code they created functions and classes which would test the documents for the various characters and letters in the English language. They also trained the AI with various scripts so that it would be able to take in and convert the handwritten documents into text, which is the backbone of Click to Text. </p>
